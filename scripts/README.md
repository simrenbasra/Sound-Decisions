# Project Scripts

To ignore this folder, scripts were not used.

IThis folder contains scripts that were originally intended for use in GitHub Workflows to automate the process from data scraping to recommending. However, I had some issues when trying to make the Streamlit app publicly accessible and ran out of time in trying to fix them.

While these scripts were not used in the current project, they may prove useful in the future if I decide to deploy my recommender system using Flask or FastAPI.

Note to self: Scripts to be updated to match changes made in notebook.
