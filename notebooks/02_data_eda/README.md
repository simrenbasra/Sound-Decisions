# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

In this section, I explore the data to uncover insights and patterns using EDA methods. I also perform transformations to adjust skewness seen in some features.

### Notebook Order and Summary

1. Data Insights [01-data-insights.ipynb]

This notebook analyses the dataset, visualising key features and identifying trends and relationships within the data.
In this notebook, I also address the skewness seen in Price and Rating.

2. Clustering [02-clustering.ipynb]

This notebook applies clustering techniques in an attempt to group the data into meaningful groups in order to understand product feature similarities. Results from the clustering were not great despite using multiple clustering methods - most likely due to the lack of depth in the data (less than 500 rows).

## Outcome

- Visualisations: Charts and graphs,showcasing the analysis and insights.
- `final_data.csv`: A dataset with all columns transformed and encoded, ready for use in the recommender system.
