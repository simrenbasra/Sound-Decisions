# Notebook Folder Overview
Stores all notebooks for the project from data scraping to recommenders.

## 1. Data Collection [01_data_collection]

This folder focuses on collecting headphone product data from Amazon, as well as the cleaning and preprocessing steps.


## 2. Data EDA [02_data_eda]

This folder contains EDA-related notebooks where I perform EDA on the collected data, providing insights into product features, distributions and report on any other trends seen in the dataset.

## 3. Recommender [03_recommendations]

This folder contains notebooks involved in the implementation of the recommender system to generate personalised headphone recommendations based on user preferences.

## Running Notebooks

1. Start with running notebooks in `01_data_collection` first to scrape and clean the data.
2. Proceed to `02_data_eda` to run EDA on the data to generate some insights.
3. Finally, run the `03_recommendations` notebook to build the recommender system.
