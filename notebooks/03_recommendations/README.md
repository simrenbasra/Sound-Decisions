# Recommeder

This folder consists of one file, `01-recommender.ipynb`. 

In this notebook, I build a content-based recommender and integrate some elements of collaborative filtering to create a hybrid recommender.

## Findings

Evaluating the recommender was challenging due to the lack of user interaction data. As a result, I performed my own checks by assessing the products suggested by the hybrid recommender. This involved calculating the feature similarity for the recommended headphones based on the given ID and determining a percentage of similarity.
